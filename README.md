## Projects

### ICU Connect ðŸŸ¢
ICU Connect serves as a social network exclusively for UZH / IFI students, enabling them to gain valuable insights into course content and quality through ratings, shared files, posts, and interactive discussions. Collaboration among students from various courses fosters knowledge sharing, ensuring the transfer of valuable information from year to year. Additionally, for those without personal connections to previous course takers, a forum with supplementary information proves highly beneficial.

Our web application consists of a Java backend, a React frontend, a MySQL database and leverages AWS services as for example the S3 service for storing and managing documents. The architecture follows a client-server model, with the backend serving as the server-side component and the frontend running in the client's browser.

### BROLAT ðŸ“…

As part of the module "Software Computer Engineering Lab" I and four other students created an application that facilitates the organization of a student's life and collaboration among peers. 

In the life of a student it is often overwhelming to get a hold of all the deadlines from the different modules. All this energy spent on organizing and planning a semester can be simplified. Therefore, we built an interactive application, where users can communicate with each other in small groups and handle all their personal or shared tasks in a simple and intuitive way. Information about various modules, tasks you need to work on and collaborations with other students is centralized in one application. A well designed homepage delivers all the information you need to know about the current week lectures, tasks, exercises, deadlines and meetings that are coming up.

### CLOUDLOCK ðŸ”’

During a three-month internship, I and another informatics student from UZH developed an IoT concept that enables the control of lockers via the cloud. This is done via the user's smartphone, resulting in low complexity, low cost and ease of use. A lot of emphasis was put on usability and compatibility with different apps (application agnostic). Finally, we designed and programmed a prototype (full-stack web application & REST API) that works via QR codes, that are placed on each compartment of a locker. Along the way, I was also able to gain insight into a market study that explored the various possible applications of the app.

### MY WEBSITE ðŸ‘©
Currently I am building my own website, which will be available under: https://stefaniekrohmann.github.io/. Stay tuned!
